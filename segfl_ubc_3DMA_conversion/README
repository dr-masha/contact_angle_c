1. COMPILATION
- type 'make'
- the executable is 'convert_ubc_3dma'

2. USAGE
convert_ubc_3dma fname_in_ubc nx ny nz fname_out_3dma
    
    fname_in_ubc - filename (including the path to it) of the unsigned char 
                   binary array; it can be zipped (.gz)
    nx,ny,nz     - number of voxels in x,y,z directions
                   The data is assumed to be packed as follows
		   packing_index = k*nx*ny + j*ny + i
		   (store data z-plane by z-plane; within each plane,
		    y direction is stored first then x
		    This is C/C++ convention.
		    Fortran and Matlab store data as 		   
		   packing_index = k*nx*ny + i*nx + j
    fname_out_3dma - filename for 3DMA file (it will be zipped  by default)	

3. TESTING
data128.gz is an original 3DMA segmented file
data128ubc.gz is an unsigned character version of it (produced by case2.22 3DMA)

If testing current routine do
> convert_ubc_3dma data128.gz 128 128 128 data128_3dma

The resulting file should be identical (in uncompressed format) to data128
