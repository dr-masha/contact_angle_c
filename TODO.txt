1. Use of mem.c and mem.h functions should be removed.
2. mem_test.c is then depracated, too.
3. I removed the use of deprecated functions in mem.c, and replaced them with
   dummies. I tried test_sphere.c, however the code has a Segmentation fault (core dumped). This seems to happen w/o invoking any real contact angle stuff.
   
4. test_sphere.c has bee compiled and tested.
5. contact_angle_main.c needs addition of the option to read in general uchar segmented files.
6. need to upload to github
7. need to add examples for all input options for contact_angle_main.c
